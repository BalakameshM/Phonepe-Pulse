#Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

Overview:
The objective of this project is to use Streamlit and Plotly to retrieve data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, process it, and display it in an interactive dashboard. Numerous metrics and statistics pertaining to transactions, users, and geographic data are included in the retrieved data.

Tools Utilized:
Python
Pandas
MySQL
mysql-connector-python
Streamlit
Plotly

The Problem Statement:
An enormous quantity of information about different metrics and statistics may be found in the Phonepe Pulse GitHub project. The objective is to gather this data, analyze it to gain knowledge, and present it in a way that is easy to understand. As part of the solution, data must be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a MySQL database. Streamlit and Plotly are then used to create a live geo-visualization dashboard.

Data Extraction: Scripting and cloning are used to extract data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub project.
Data Transformation: The required cleaning and preprocessing procedures are carried out, and the extracted data is converted into an appropriate format.
